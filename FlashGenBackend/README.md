}
```

## ðŸ§  Prompt Template (Backend Logic)

The backend wraps the user input with this format:

```
Convert the following text into flashcards in Q&A format.
Each flashcard should look like:
Q: [question]
A: [answer]

Additional instruction: [your custom prompt]

Text:
[your text here]
```

---

## ðŸ§© Notes

- FlashGenDesktop parses the returned text using simple `Q:` / `A:` or `Question:` / `Answer:` formats.
- Ensure that the output from the AI is consistent with that format for reliable parsing.
